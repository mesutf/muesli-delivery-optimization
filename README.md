# Speeding Up Muesli Deliveries – Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project investigates **lead time optimization** in supply chain logistics.  
It aims to identify factors affecting delivery delays and build predictive models for faster, more reliable shipments.

## Dataset
- Simulated dataset of delivery times, order quantities, and shipping modes.  

## Objectives
- Investigate factors impacting lead time.  
- Conduct A/B testing between shipping modes.  
- Build predictive models for future lead time predictions.  
- Provide recommendations to enhance operational efficiency.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Key Insights
- Shipping mode significantly impacts delivery speed.  
- Predictive model achieved strong accuracy in forecasting delays.  
- Recommendations provided to reduce average delivery time and increase efficiency.
